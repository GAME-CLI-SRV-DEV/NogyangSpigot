## PSA
> [!CAUTION]
> Attention all NogyangSpigot users, This is an urgent Public Service Announcement from the NogyangSpigot Plugin Product Safety Commission. We have identified a critical issue with the Kauri anti-cheat plugin, manufactured by funkemunky.
>
> It has come to our attention that this plugin is causing false positives for Bedrock players.
> Numerous reports have been received from Bedrock players stating that the plugin has unjustly
>  banned their friends.
>
> In light of these findings, we are issuing a mandatory recall of all Kauri anti-cheat units. If you are currently using this plugin with NogyangSpigot, we strongly advise you to remove it 
> immediately. This plugin is now considered harmful to Bedrock players and potentially damaging
> to servers.
>
> Effective immediately, we are severing all ties with funkemunky. We are also considering issuing an order for the developers to disband. funkemunky is now considered an adversary of NogyangSpigot and Bedrock users.
We thank you for your understanding and cooperation in this matter. Our priority is to ensure a safe and enjoyable gaming environment for all players.

## Message To The Official Author Of Bukkit,Wesley Wolfe
Dear Wesley Wolfe,

I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for your contributions to the Bukkit API. Your work has enabled many developers, including myself, to create mods and plugins that enhance the Minecraft experience for players around the world. I recently created NogyangSpigot, which implements the Bukkit API, and I wanted to thank you for your role in making that possible.

Your dedication to the Bukkit project has not gone unnoticed, and I am grateful for the time and effort you have put into it. Thank you again for your contributions, and I wish you all the best in your future endeavors.

Sincerely, Me(outfit8TSB/MFirms548/CensingSmile123)
